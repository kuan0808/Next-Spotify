# Next Spotify

Project Description

## Pending

- [ ] Next-auth authentication issues
  - [ ] Refreshed access token expiry time not updating

- [ ] SSR & Recoil states
  - [ ] Data for server side props too large
  - [ ] Compability issues: To much helper states in order to invalidate server side props

- [ ] Spotify API issues
  - [x] Already use chaining promises to active a device, but still need to refresh the page after an unknown error
        - Fixed the promise chain so that it performs properly now
  - [x] Request the current song after previous/next song operation, but always lag by 1
        - Use setTimeout to prevent getting the lagged result

- [ ] Maybe switch to React-query hydration with SSR

## Completed âœ“

- [x] Use SSR to reduce initial page flickering, hence better UX
